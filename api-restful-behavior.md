# API Restful Behavior

An API Restful uses the HTTP verbs for define this behavior:

- GET: For get data
- POST: For create new data
- PUT: For modify data
- DELETE: For delete data

Also, an API Restful uses HTTP Status Codes for the responses. The most important are:

- 200: Success
- 201: Element created
- 400: Bad request
- 401: Unauthorized
- 500: Internal server error
