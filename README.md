## Project requirements
My weekly diet is a platform for plan a weekly menu. It is composed by a Web API, a Web UI and a Mobile App. 

In this project, it's needed to manage diary food (breakfast, lunch and dinner). A menu is composed by a set of plates, and a plate is composed by a set of ingredients and meals. Also, a meal is composed by a set of ingredients.

The users need to manage the menu and when they have to eat it. They can create the plates, meals, and ingredientes. There are a set of master data, but they can create **his own items**.

> A user can use the master data (plate, meal or ingredient), but nobody except himself can see his personal items.
